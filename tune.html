            <h2>Tuning</h2>
            <p>Balance stability, responsiveness, and tire management for optimal performance. 
                Adjust aero for track type—higher downforce for technical circuits, lower for straights. 
                Set brake balance around 52-54% to prevent lockups. Fine-tune suspension for rotation, with 
                softer front springs aiding turn-in and stiffer rears improving traction. Adjust differential 
                for cornering stability, and refine TC/ABS based on grip and tire wear. Optimize tire pressures 
                for consistent grip and performance. Gradual testing and adjustments are key for the best setup.</p>

            <h2>Break Bias</h2>
            <p>Brake bias controls the balance of braking force between the front and rear wheels, affecting 
                stability and turn-in. In the BMW M4 GT3, a typical starting point is 52-54% forward, but 
                adjustments depend on track conditions and driving style. A higher front bias improves stability 
                under braking but may cause understeer. A lower front bias helps with rotation but increases the 
                risk of rear lockups. In wet conditions or worn tires, shifting bias slightly forward can improve 
                control. Fine-tuning brake bias per corner can enhance braking efficiency and overall performance.</p>

            <h2>Downforce</h2>
            <p>Downforce enhances grip by increasing aerodynamic pressure, improving cornering speed and stability. 
                In the BMW M4 GT3, higher downforce settings provide better traction and braking performance, ideal 
                for technical circuits with many corners. Lower downforce reduces drag, increasing top speed for 
                tracks with long straights but requiring more precise braking and throttle control. Balancing front 
                and rear wing levels is crucial—too much front can cause oversteer, while too much rear can create 
                understeer. Adjusting downforce should complement suspension and tire settings to maximize overall 
                performance.</p>
