            <h2>Driving in the M4 GT3</h2> 
            <p>
                Driving the BMW M4 GT3 requires smooth, precise inputs to maximize performance. For braking, apply firm 
                pressure in a straight line and gradually release it into corners, using trail braking to maintain grip.
                 In cornering, focus on smooth weight transfer and avoid excessive steering to preserve grip. Throttle 
                 control is crucial, especially on exits, as the strong power delivery requires careful modulation to 
                 prevent traction loss. In high-speed corners, maintaining momentum is key to maximizing aerodynamic grip. 
                Lastly, manage traction and tire wear, adjusting your driving style as rear grip decreases. 
                Precision in braking, cornering, and throttle application is essential for optimal performance.

            <h2>Racing Line and Cornering</h2>
            <p>The optimal racing line is the fastest path around a track, maximizing speed and minimizing lap time. 
                It typically follows a wide entry, tight apex, and wide exit but varies based on corner type, car dynamics, 
                and conditions.
                In hairpins, a late apex allows for earlier acceleration, while fast sweepers require a balanced approach to 
                maintain stability. Chicanes demand precise transitions to carry speed efficiently. In wet conditions, 
                drivers may avoid the rubbered-in line for better grip. Additionally, race strategy, tire wear, 
                and traffic influence line choices, requiring adaptability to maintain optimal performance.</p>

            <h2>Braking</h2>
            <p>In the BMW M4 GT3, braking technique varies by corner type. For slow corners, brake hard in a straight line, 
                then smoothly release pressure to maintain control. In medium-speed turns, trail braking helps keep the front 
                loaded for better rotation. For high-speed corners, a light brake or lift shifts weight forward for improved 
                grip without unsettling the car. 
                Adjust braking points based on tire wear, fuel load, and track conditions for optimal performance.</p>

        <div class="race">
            <h2>Gear Shifting</h2>
            <p>In racing, shifting gears at the right moment is crucial for maintaining optimal acceleration and stability. 
                Upshifting should occur just before the engine's power curve drops off, typically slightly before the rev 
                limiter, to maximize acceleration without hitting the limiter and losing momentum. For turbocharged engines, 
                shifting a bit earlier helps stay within the power band and avoid lag. Downshifting should be done under braking, 
                ensuring rev-matching (either manually with heel-toe or through auto-blip) to prevent unsettling the car. 
                Shifting too early on downshifts can cause excessive engine braking, which may lock the rear wheels and reduce 
                stability. Proper shift timing also depends on factors like tire wear, fuel load, and track conditions, 
                so adapting your approach throughout the race is key to maintaining consistency and performance.</p>
